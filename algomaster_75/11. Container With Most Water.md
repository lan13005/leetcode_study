```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0

        # Time Complexity: O(n) — Each pointer (left and right) moves at most n times in total.
        #    We choose to move the pointer with lower height every iteration which is sufficient
        # Space Complexity: O(1) — Constant extra space used.
        while right > left:
            rheight = height[right]
            lheight = height[left]
            water_level = min(rheight, lheight)
            area = water_level * (right - left)
            if area > max_area:
                max_area = area
            # max_area = max(max_area, area) # slower since it does a function call, passing args, return result
            if rheight > lheight:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
