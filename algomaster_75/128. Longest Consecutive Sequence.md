The key is the initial loop over the array to determine sequence starting positions

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums = set(nums)  # O(n) time to convert list to set, O(n) space
        starts = {}       # O(n) space in the worst case (every number is a start)
        longest_streak = 0

        # First pass to identify sequence starting points
        for num in nums:  # O(n) time
            if num - 1 not in nums:  # O(1) average time per lookup
                starts[num] = 1      # O(1) insertion

        # Second pass to compute sequence lengths
        for start in starts:  # O(n) time in worst case
            streak = 1
            while start + streak in nums:  # Each element is visited at most once
                streak += 1
            if streak > longest_streak:
                longest_streak = streak

        return longest_streak
```
